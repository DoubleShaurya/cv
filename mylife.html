  <h1>My life there</h1>
  <p>I am good there and am doing well. I have made some friends and I am comfortable in my new school. Going
    back home is one problem by the way. Some examples of fun there:
  <ul>
    <li>VS145 (For <strong>my</strong> particular year)</li>
    <li>Victorians' Lounge</li>
    <li>etc. (To be updated later)</li>
  </ul>
